# Reduced Lens Wiki Source Files
This repo contains the file system and SQL database for the Reduced Lens Wiki, which ran on [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki). See the releases.

You probably know what you're doing if you want to restore this backup of the wiki to a server. Have fun!
